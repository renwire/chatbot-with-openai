# chatbot-with-openai

Based on the work of Gohulan. It has evolved a bit but it is workable to build on. For now you can talk to the ai in CMD and it will remember your conversation until you either run out of tokens or you type exit. I am planing to implement a data base to store the chat history. Just need to do more research. Enjoy and have a good day.
